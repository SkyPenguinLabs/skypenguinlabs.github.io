        "description": "Unlike most educational providers, we give: continuous deals on all products, always have free content to release, let you preview & demo up to 20+ pages for all digital written content, maintain and produce our own artwork, not AI generated BS, not AI engineered, not even AI grown. So, should we list more? Cause we can? We do what everybody else in today's world chooses to run away from: actual development. "

        "description": "Curious to learn? Tired of AI content? Tired of content creators saying 'we have the golden path' and delivering shit on a silver platter? Then you are mean't for us. We don't promise to give you the path to success - we admit this is personal and is not viable to give. But, we will promise to deliver high quality, specific, niche educative and quantitative information that is affordable for everybody. We don't: make you sign up to a platform, try to push you to sales teams, try to push you to give us an email or all that nonsense. Simply browse, and enjoy! ^_^  "
